- 👋 Hi, I’m Angel Ramon Melo, 24 years old guy from the Dominican Republic.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about coding and developing, im really new at all this, really really new, but I'm going to do my best to be the best of me in this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics about programming, and I'm starting with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who can help me grow, and somehow, me helping them too.
- 📫 You can contact me on my instagram, @angelrmel.
